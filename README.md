# cybersecurity-portfolio
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!

I am an Air Force Veteran with 6 years of experience in cybersecurity. I first started my cybersecurity journey when I joined the Air Force and became a Cyber Systems Operator. So far I have gained experience with Windows, Windows servers, Linux, Linux servers, and even networking hardware. I have became a very well rounded System Administrator, but felt like there was more to learn. That's when I enrolled in SANS Institution and started my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Cybersecurity learning Blue Team and Red Team tactics/techniques. I have learned a lot so far during my studies, but most recently has been the NCL Fall 2025 Capture-The-Flag event.

# A reflection on your CTF experience
The Fall 2025 NCL CTF was an extremely challenging event that put all of the information I learned in past SANS courses to test. The CTF consisted of 3 different games; the Practice Game running 7 days, the Individual Game running 3 days, and the Team Game also running 3 days.
