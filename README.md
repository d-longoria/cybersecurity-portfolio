Hello, I'm Daniel. Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!

I am an Air Force Veteran with 6 years of experience in cybersecurity. I first started my cybersecurity journey when I joined the Air Force and became a Cyber Systems Operator. So far I have gained experience with Windows, Linux, and networking. Over the years, I have became a very well rounded System Administrator, but felt like there was more to learn in the cyber space. That's when I enrolled in SANS Technology Institute and started my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Cybersecurity learning Blue Team and Red Team tactics/techniques. I have learned a lot so far during my studies and have recieved many different certifications such as the GFACT, GSEC, GCIH, and soon GPYC.

## Objective

My current goals are to continue passing my SANS courses and certifications, while learning as much as I can and bringing it to my team at work. I am about halfway through my degree and am currenty taking SEC573 + GPYC as well as BACS 3001, which incldues the NCL Fall 2025 Capture-The-Flag event. The NCL Fall 2025 event was my first ever CTF, and it helped me understand what sections I am excelling at and what sections I need more work on. I linked my Individual Game Scouting Report below, but to summarize, I now know that I need to work on Network Traffic Analysis, Forensics, and Web Enumeration & Exploitation.
